Code Insitute template was used for creation of repository of this site. [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template)

### Setting Up Repository

I took these steps to setup my Github repository:
- Open the link to the Code Institute template mentioned above.
- At the top right corner click the button 'Use this template'.
- Click first option 'Create a new repository.
- Give the repository a relevant name and description.
- Make sure the repository remains public.
- At the bottom right click 'Create repository'.

This allows you to save a local copy.

Steps:
- Navigate to the GitHub page for the desired repository.
- Click on 'Code'
- Copy the link provided under HTTPS.
- Open Git Bash.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
